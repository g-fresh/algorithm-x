<h2 id="section-1">1. Introduction</h2>

<p>This article describes some of the technical challenges involved in 
implementing a sudoku puzzle generation algorithm on a handheld video 
game console, and how the developers at <a href="http://www.zoonami.com/">Zoonami Limited</a> solved them in the production of <a href="http://www.zendokugame.com/"><i>Zendoku</i></a>, released in Spring 2007 on the <a href="http://www.nintendo.com/systemsds">Nintendo DS</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_Portable">Sony PSP</a>.</p>


<h2 id="section-2">2. Requirements</h2>

<p>Let’s start by considering the requirements the puzzle generator must satisfy.</p>

<ol>
<li>It must generate proper sudoku puzzles: there must be exactly one valid way to complete the grid.</li>
<li>It must be able to generate puzzles with a wide range of 
difficulties, so that we can please players of different skills, and so 
that we can present a graded series of difficulties in <i>Zendoku</i>’s story mode.</li>
<li>At each difficulty level, puzzles must not differ very much in 
difficulty. A player’s progress must not depend mainly on how lucky they
 get with the generator algorithm.</li>
<li>It must produce a puzzle quickly on the Nintendo DS. It would be 
rather unfortunate to have to resort to a “generating puzzle… please 
wait” screen. Ideally, there should be no more than a second or so 
between the player selecting a difficulty level and starting to play the
 puzzle—no more time than it takes to animate the transition from the 
menu to the game.</li>
<li>The method must be cheap to develop, in terms of programmer time, as
 we had only two programmers with whom to make a cross-platform console 
game.</li>
</ol>


<h2 id="section-3">3. Strategic overview</h2>

<p>The strategy we picked was <i>generate-and-test</i>.  This uses two algorithms: a <i>generator</i> which produces, in an unguided fashion, sudoku puzzles of unknown difficulty; and a <i>grader</i>,
 which works out how difficult each puzzle is.  If a puzzle is the wrong
 difficulty we throw it away and generate another candidate.</p>

<p>This approach may seem rather odd at first sight, even wasteful. It’s
 certainly quite unlike the way that human setters create sudoku 
puzzles.  However, it has two advantages that were key for us: it’s 
straightforward to develop, requiring little in the way of research, and
 reliable in practice: given a generator that does a good job of 
sampling the space of puzzles, and a grader that does a decent job of 
determining the difficulty, getting the puzzle we’re after is a simple 
matter of putting in enough CPU time.  Note that this may cause us some 
difficulties for in creating puzzles fast enough—see <a href="#section-2">requirement 4</a>—but we can worry about that later—see <a href="#section-6">section 6</a>.</p>

<p>Copying the methods of human setters seemed likely to be impractical 
in the very limited time available, an exercise suited more for a 
research project than a commercial game.  Also, it seemed likely that to
 program these methods we would have to become reasonably proficient in 
them ourselves, and that would also take time we didn’t have.</p>

<p>A fallback possibility that we always had in mind was that we could 
include with the game some pre-prepared puzzles.  If our 
generate-and-test approach proved to be too slow to run on the console 
itself, we could at least run it in our office and include the output in
 the game.  Or, if we completely failed to produce a decent generator, 
we could buy in puzzles from a composer.  This approach worked for 
Hudson’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku_Gridmaster"><i>Sudoku Gridmaster</i></a> which contains “more than 400” built-in puzzles, created by Japanese puzzle company <a href="http://www.nikoli.co.jp/en/">Nikoli</a>.
 However, this would be less suitable for a puzzle fighting game, which 
ought to be able to support endless replay.  We could disguise the fact 
that we were reusing puzzles from the built-in set by permuting the 
symbols, rows and columns, but the experience would probably end up 
being a bit “samey” after a while.  It also seemed like a bit of a 
cop-out!</p>


<h2 id="section-4">4. Generator</h2>

<p>The basic idea behind our puzzle generator is as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>Generate a random grid satisfying all the sudoku constraints.</li>
<li>Pick a random permutation of the cells in the grid.</li>
<li>For each cell in the permuted order: remove the symbol in that cell;
 check to see if this has left the puzzle with multiple solutions; if 
so, put the cell back.</li>
</ol>

<p>This generates an “irreducible puzzle”: a grid from which no more 
cells can be removed without leaving multiple solutions. It’s a sudoku 
puzzle, but at this stage we don’t know anything about how hard it is!</p>

<p>For step (3) we need a fast solver (fast because it has to be run 
many times for each puzzle we generate).  And having built a solver, 
it’s easy to modify it to generate the completed grids in step (1), by 
starting solving with an empty grid and making random choices when 
available.</p>

<p>The structure of the sudoku puzzle makes it an ideal candidate for representation as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constraint_satisfaction_problem">constraint satisfaction problem</a>.
  This approach has two neat aspects: it treats all the constraints 
equally, so there’s no need to code up a distinction between choosing a 
number to put in a cell and choosing a cell to put a number in; and 
there’s a clever way of implementing the algorithm (Donald Knuth’s 
“Dancing Links”; see <a href="#section-4.3">section 4.3</a>) which 
allows choices that are ruled out by the constraints to be quickly 
eliminated, and quickly put in again when backtracking.</p>


<h3 id="section-4.1">4.1 Example: solving a 2×2 Latin square</h3>

<p>I’ll illustrate the constraint satisfaction approach with a very 
(very!) small problem: the solution of 2×2 Latin squares.  A Latin 
square is like a sudoku except that there are no blocks, so in this case
 we have to put the numbers 1 and 2 into the cells of a 2×2 grid so that
 there is a 1 and a 2 in each row and each column (see <a href="#figure-1">figure 1</a>).</p>

<table class="display ruled" style="width:100px">
<caption id="figure-1"><b>Figure 1. Solve this 2×2 Latin square!</b></caption>
<tbody><tr><td style="width:2em">&nbsp;</td><td style="width:2em">&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td style="width:2em">&nbsp;</td><td style="width:2em">&nbsp;</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>You should find it straightforward to check by hand that there are exactly two solutions!</p>

<p>We begin by building a matrix whose columns are the constraints and 
whose rows are possible choices of placement.  In the case of 2×2 Latin 
squares, there are 12 constraints (3 types of constraint, 2×2 = 4 
constraints of each type).</p>

<ul>
<li>Constraints 1–4: We must place some number in each cell.</li>
<li>Constraints 5–8: We must place each number somewhere in each row.</li>
<li>Constraints 9–12: We must place each number somewhere in each column.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are 8 choices of placement: either number may be placed in each
 cell.  Expressed as a binary matrix, the combinations of constraints 
satisfied by each choice is shown in <a href="#figure-2">figure 2</a>.</p>

<p class="display centred" id="figure-2"><b>Figure 2. Constraint matrix for a 2×2 Latin square.</b><br>
<img src="zendoku%20puzzle%20generation-files/constraint-matrix.png" alt="Constraint matrix for a 2×2 Latin square." width="483" height="373"></p>

<p>The size of this table should make it clear why I’ve chosen such a 
small example: the smallest sudoku, 4×4, has 64 constraints and 64 ways 
of placing a number, while a 9×9 sudoku has 324 constraints and 729 ways
 of placing a number.  You can see the entire matrix for the latter <a href="http://www.stolaf.edu/people/hansonr/sudoku/exactcovermatrix.htm">illustrated in glorious ASCII</a> by Robert Hanson.</p>

<p>So how does this constraint matrix help? Well, every solution to the 
Latin square corresponds to a subset of rows from this matrix such that 
each constraint is covered exactly once—that is, each column has a 
single black square in the chosen subset of rows.  Computer scientists 
will recognize this as an instance of the well-known NP-hard <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exact_cover"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">EXACT COVER</span> problem</a>.</p>

<p><a href="#figure-3">Figure 3</a> shows the rows corresponding to a solution to the 2×2 Latin square. Note that each column contains a single black square.</p>

<h3 id="section-4.2">4.2 “Algorithm X”</h3>

<p>We can find solution sets, if any exist, by a straightforward 
application of depth-first search with backtracking.  In particular, we 
can incrementally build up a set of rows making up a solution as 
follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>Pick an unsatisfied constraint: that is, a column with no black cell
 in any of the rows in the solution set.  If there are no unsatisfied 
constraints remaining, the solution set is complete: if all we wanted 
was any solution, we’re done; if we want all solutions, then make note 
of the solution we’ve got and then backtrack to the previous time we 
chose a row and take the next choice instead.</li>
<li>Pick a row that satisfies that constraint: that is, one with a black
 cell in the chosen column.  If there is no such row, then we’ve reached
 a dead end and we must backtrack to the previous time we chose a row 
and take the next choice instead.</li>
<li>Add that row to the solution set.</li>
<li>Delete all rows that satisfy any of the constraints satisfied by the
 chosen row: that is, all rows that have a black cell in the same column
 as a black cell in the chosen row.</li>
<li>Return to step 1.</li>
</ol>

<p>Donald Knuth <a href="http://lanl.arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0011047">comments</a>
 on this algorithm, “I will call [it] algorithm X for lack of a better 
name […] Algorithm X is simply a statement of the obvious 
trial-and-error approach. (Indeed, I can’t think of any other reasonable
 way to do the job, in general.)”</p>

<p>The choice of constraint at step 1 doesn’t affect the correctness of 
the algorithm, but makes a great deal of difference to its running 
speed. The obvious heuristic is to always pick the constraint satisfied 
by the smallest number of rows, as this reduces the branching factor of 
the search. Knuth calls this the “<i>S</i> heuristic”; see <a href="#section-4.4">section 4.4</a> for how well it performs in sudoku.</p>

<p>The choice of row at step 2 doesn’t affect the correctness of the 
algorithm either, so long as the backtracking makes sure to visit all 
satisfying rows, but if there are multiple solutions the choice does 
affect the order in which the solutions are generated.</p>

<p><a href="#figure-4">Figure 4</a> shows this algorithm applied to our example.  The algorithm makes a bad decision at step 6 and has to backtrack.</p>

<h3 id="section-4.3">4.3 “Dancing Links”</h3>

<p>Donald Knuth describes an efficient technique for implementing Algorithm X, which he calls “<a href="http://lanl.arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0011047">Dancing Links</a>”.  This starts with the observation that in typical instances of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">EXACT COVER</span>
 problem, the number of constraints satisfied by each row is quite 
small.  This is particularly true in 9×9 sudoku, where the full 
constraint matrix has 324 columns and 729 rows—236,196 cells in all—but 
only 2,916 of those cells are occupied.</p>

<p>We need to be able to search efficiently along columns (in steps 2 
and 4) and along rows (in step 4), so we’ll make linked lists for each 
row and column.  We need to be able to efficiently remove cells from 
their column (in step 4) so we’ll use doubly-linked lists.  This means 
that each occupied cell has four pointers, going to the occupied cells 
to the left, right, above and below.  We also need to be able to pick 
the best column to search (at step 1) so we’ll have additional data 
structures representing columns, with a count of the number of occupied 
cells in each.</p>

<p><a href="#figure-5">Figure 5</a> shows the initial setup of the 
matrix ready for searching.  The blue cells are the column headers, each
 storing the number of cells in that column.  The extra cell at the top 
left is the root of the whole data structure; it’s there so that we can 
find the column headers of the constraints that we haven’t satisfied 
yet.  The dashed lines indicate links that wrap around the diagram.</p>

<p class="display centred" style="width:491px;" id="figure-5"><b>Figure 5. Dancing Links matrix for the 2×2 Latin square.</b>
<img src="zendoku%20puzzle%20generation-files/dancing-links-1.png" alt="Initial setup of the Dancing Links matrix for the 2×2 Latin square." width="491" height="366"></p>

<p>The basic operation is to remove a column from the matrix, together 
with all the rows that intersect that column.  This operation can be 
used to implement step 1 and step 4.  Knuth calls this “covering a 
column”.  <a href="#figure-6">Figure 6</a> shows the matrix after 
covering the leftmost column.  The green cells have been removed from 
the matrix; the red arrows show the links that have been altered.</p>

<p class="display centred" style="width:491px;" id="figure-6"><b>Figure 6. “Covering” a column.</b>
<img src="zendoku%20puzzle%20generation-files/dancing-links-2.png" alt="“Covering” the leftmost column in the Dancing Links implementation of Algorithm X." width="491" height="366"></p>

<p>The key observation that makes Dancing Links efficient is that as 
long as you store a pointer to the column header, the “covering” 
operation is easy to reverse.  That’s because the cells that have been 
removed from matrix (coloured green in <a href="#figure-6">figure 6</a>)
 still have pointers to their neighbours; they can be used to reverse 
the operation; Knuth calls this “uncovering a column”.  In <a href="#figure-7">figure 7</a> these pointers are marked in red.</p>

<p class="display centred" style="width:491px;" id="figure-7"><b>Figure 7. The pointers that can be used to “uncover” the column.</b>

<p>We need to take some care when backtracking to uncover the columns in
 precisely the reverse order to that in which we covered them.  For the 
fiddly details, see Knuth’s “<a href="http://lanl.arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0011047">Dancing Links</a>” paper.</p>


<h3 id="section-4.4">4.4 Application to sudoku</h3>

<p class="sidebar centred" style="width:262px;" id="figure-8"><b>Figure 8. A tricky 9×9 sudoku.</b><br>

<p>The “Dancing Links” algorithm needs to run in two modes:</p>

<ol>
<li>To generate a random solved grid.  In this mode we stop the solver 
as soon as it reaches a solution.  We want it to choose rows in a random
 order at step 2 of the algorithm, so that a good subset of the space of
 grids is reachable.  We populate the top row of the grid with a random 
permutation of the nine symbols before running the solver.  This gives a
 slight speedup—about 5%—over starting it on an empty grid.</li>
<li>To check a candidate puzzle to see if it has multiple solutions.  In
 this mode we stop the solver when it finds a second solution (if any), 
or when it has examined the whole search tree and established that there
 is only a single solution.  In this mode we don’t care what order it 
chooses rows in at step 2, so we can save the effort of generating 
random numbers.</li>
</ol>

<p>The “<i>S</i> heuristic” (choosing the column with the fewest rows) 
is very effective indeed.  In a test of 100 randomly generated puzzles, 
the algorithm using the <i>S</i> heuristic used 345,810 search nodes to 
prove that each puzzle had a single solution.  The same solver without 
the heuristic (always looking at the leftmost remaining column) needed 
49,879,323 nodes to do the same.</p>

<p>This rough-and-ready test suggests that the <i>S</i> heuristic thus 
gives a speedup of about 144 times.  But the distribution is quite wide.
  For easy puzzles, the speedup is often no more than 10 times.  But 
some puzzles seem particularly tricky, for example when tackling the 
sudoku puzzle in <a href="#figure-8">figure 8</a> (from Gordon Royle’s <a href="http://people.csse.uwa.edu.au/gordon/sudokumin.php">Minimum Sudoku</a> collection) the solver using the <i>S</i>
 heuristic uses only 64 nodes to prove that there is a single solution 
(no backtracking is necessary), while the solver without the heuristic 
needs 21,677,544 nodes, for a speedup of 338,711 times.</p>

<p>On the Nintendo DS, a rough rule of thumb was that it takes less than a frame (<sup>1</sup>/<sub>60</sub>&nbsp;s) for the solver to prove that a candidate puzzle has a single solution.</p>


<h3 id="section-4.5">4.5 Removing givens</h3>

<p>The “Dancing Links” solver generates a solved sudoku grid.  To make a
 puzzle, we remove symbols until removing any more would allow multiple 
solutions.</p>

<p>The table in <a href="#figure-9">figure 9</a> shows the distribution 
of given symbols remaining after removing as many symbols as possible  
(based on 1,000 runs of the generator algorithm).</p>

<h3 id="section-5.1">5.1 Overview </h3>

<p>The design of the grader is quite straightforward.  We have a 
repertoire of deduction tactics that we believe human solvers might use,
 ranked in order of their difficulty.  At each stage the grader applies 
each of the tactics in turn, starting with the easiest, until one 
results in a symbol being written in.  The difficulty of the hardest 
tactic used during the stage is recorded.</p>

<p>This process gives an order of solution of the puzzle, together with 
the difficulty of deducing each symbol.  The difficulty of the whole 
puzzle is simply the difficulty of the hardest symbol.  (We looked at 
more sophisticated measures of overall difficulty, such as the average 
of the difficulty of the deductions, but the evidence from playing the 
game is that no number of easy deductions can be the equivalent of a 
single hard deduction.)</p>

<p><a href="#figure-10">Figure 10</a> shows a puzzle graded “hard”, with
 the given symbols in black and the symbols to be deduced in pink.  The 
small numbers in the bottom right of each cell give the order in which 
the symbols were deduced by the grader; each “normal” move is annotated 
with a plus sign (+); each “hard” move is annotated with a star (★); and
 the remaining “easy” moves are plain.</p>

<h3 id="section-5.2">5.2 Tactics</h3>

<p>The tactics that the grader knows about are listed below.  The names 
are by no means universally accepted, but are common on the web: see for
 example Simon Armstrong’s collection of <a href="http://www.sadmansoftware.com/sudoku/techniques.htm">solving techniques</a>.</p>

<ol>
<li>Final symbol in set.  A row, column, or block has eight symbols in it, which means that we can deduce the last one.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.sadmansoftware.com/sudoku/technique1.htm">Naked single</a>.  A symbol which can only go into one of the cells of a row, column, or block.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.sadmansoftware.com/sudoku/technique2.htm">Hidden single</a>.  A cell in which only one symbol can go.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.sadmansoftware.com/sudoku/technique5.htm">Naked pair</a>.  Two symbols which can only go into two of the cells of a row, column, or block.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.sadmansoftware.com/sudoku/technique9.htm">Hidden pair</a>.  Two cells into which only two symbols can go.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.sadmansoftware.com/sudoku/technique5.htm">Naked triple</a>.  Three symbols which can only go into three of the cells of a row, column, or block.</li>
</ol>

<p>A look through the literature on solving sudoku shows a number of other kinds of deductions with exotic names like “<a href="http://www.sadmansoftware.com/sudoku/technique6.htm">x-wing</a>” and “<a href="http://www.sadmansoftware.com/sudoku/technique13.htm">swordfish</a>”.
  However, these are generally difficult deductions suited to 
pencil-and-paper puzzles.  For the faster-paced pencil-less gameplay of <i>Zendoku</i>,
 it would not be fun if players were required to make these kinds of 
deductions.  Indeed, even with this small set of deductions, at the 
“expert” level of difficulty it’s probably <a href="http://garethrees.org/2007/06/07/zendoku-tactics/#guessing">just as effective to guess the difficult moves</a> and accept the penalty for guessing wrong as it is to actually try to deduce the move.</p>

<p>If you were composing pencil-and-paper puzzles using this 
generate-and-test approach, you would want a much larger set of tactics.</p>


<h3 id="section-5.3">5.3 What if the difficulty isn’t right?</h3>

<p>The grader gives us an estimate of how difficult the puzzle is.  So 
what if the puzzle is the wrong difficulty, for example if we want an 
“easy” puzzle but the grader tells us we have a “normal” puzzle in hand?
  If the puzzle is too easy, we just throw it away and ask the generator
 for another.  But if the puzzle is too hard, there’s a neat way to make
 it easier.  The grader gives us the difficulty of deducing each symbol,
 so we can simply fill in all the symbols that are too hard for the 
difficulty level we want.  (This might overshoot and make the puzzle 
easier than we want, so except in the case where we want an easy puzzle,
 we still have to check the result.  But that’s cheaper than generating a
 new puzzle.)</p>

<p><a href="#figure-11">Figure 11</a> shows the distribution of 
difficulty of puzzles as they emerge from the generator (based on 1,000 
runs of the generator algorithm).</p>

<p><a href="#figure-12">Figure 12</a> shows how successful the 
difficulty adjustment is, by giving the proportion of generated puzzles 
that can be converted to each dificulty level by filling in symbols that
 are too hard for that level (based on 1,000 runs of the generator 
algorithm).</p>

<img src="zendoku%20puzzle%20generation-files/distribution-of-success.png" alt="Table giving the proportion of generated puzzles that are suitable for conversion to each difficulty level by filling in symbols that are too hard to deduce at that level:
easy 100%
normal 33.3%
hard 39.5%
expert 30.7%
master 45.4%
" width="446" height="124"></p>

<p>There’s a final wrinkle.  It turns out that it’s tricky to make fine 
enough distinctions at the easy end of the difficulty spectrum.  When we
 playtested the game, it became apparent that puzzles graded “easy” 
spanned quite a wide range of difficulties, even though the deductions 
were much the same from one puzzle to another.  (By that stage, we the 
developers had solved so many sudokus in the course of development that 
we no longer had any useful intuition about the difficulty of the 
puzzles!)  It seems that the crucial factor is the “width” of the 
puzzle: how many deductions are available at a given time.  When there 
are lots of available deductions, it’s usually straightforward to find 
one of them quickly.  When there are few, it takes longer to find them 
and the puzzle seems difficult.</p>

<p>We could have incorporated the number of available deductions into 
the grading calculations.  But with little time remaining for testing, 
we found a quick but inelegant hack that seemed to do a good job of 
fixing the problem.  Since more deductions become available as you enter
 more symbols, we specify for each difficulty level a minimum number of 
given symbols and simply enter symbols to the puzzle until the minimum 
number is reached.  This results in puzzles that wouldn’t pass muster in
 some newspapers—because some of the given symbols are deducible from 
some of the others—but do just fine in a video game.</p>


<h2 id="section-6">6. Speed</h2>

<p><a href="#figure-12">Figure 12</a> shows that we may need to run the 
generation and grading algorithms several times before hitting on a 
puzzle that’s of the right difficulty level.  On the Nintendo DS this 
may take several seconds, so it looks as if we are in some danger of 
failing <a href="#section-2">requirement 4</a>.</p>

<p>To avoid the player having to wait, we arrange to keep a stock of 
puzzles at each difficulty in the saved data. When the player starts 
playing one of these puzzles, we start generating a new puzzle of that 
difficulty to fill the vacant slot.  This generation can take place in a
 low-priority background thread while the game is being played.</p>


<h2 id="section-7">7. Other uses for the grader</h2>

<p>The grader takes a sudoku puzzle and returns a suggested move order 
together with the difficulty of each move.  This algorithm comes in 
useful in two other places in the game.</p>

<p>In <i>Zendoku</i>’s solo modes, the grader is run in the background 
when the player makes a move.  The first few moves in the suggested move
 order are displayed as hints.  Note that we can’t just look at the move
 order for the original puzzle, as we have to take into account the 
moves that the player has made so far.  If the player has made a wrong 
move, we don’t want to give this away by offering incorrect hints or 
failing to offer hints any more.</p>

<p>In the story mode, the grader is run in the background to generate 
the next move for the AI.  The AI makes the first move suggested by the 
move order, taking time based on a function of the difficulty of the 
move and the “skill” of the AI.  Again, we can’t just let the AI use the
 original move order for the puzzle, because the player may have 
“fumbled” (made a mistake), resulting in a gift of symbols to the AI.  
The AI’s play needs to take into account these extra symbols, as they 
will have made certain moves unnecessary, and other moves easier.</p>


<h2 id="section-8">8. Competitors</h2>

<p><i>Zendoku</i> was not the first sudoku game for a handheld console 
to have puzzle generation capabilities; we were beaten to the punch by 
UFO Interactive’s <a href="http://ufointeractivegames.com/details.asp?k=2419&amp;p=nds"><i>Sudoku Mania</i></a>, whose “auto-generating algorithm allows for an infinite number of puzzles”.</p>

<p>Other competitors include:</p>

<ul>

<li>Nintendo’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_Age:_Train_Your_Brain_in_Minutes_a_Day%21"><i>Brain Age</i></a>: “more than 100” puzzles.</li>

<li>Hudson’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku_Gridmaster"><i>Sudoku Gridmaster</i></a>: “more than 400” puzzles.</li>

<li>D3’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essential_Sudoku_DS"><i>Essential Sudoku DS</i></a>: 1,000 puzzles.</li>

<li>Ubisoft’s <a href="http://www.ubi.com/UK/Games/Info.aspx?pId=5582"><i>Platinum Sudoku</i></a>:
 “20,000,000 different grids”.  It’s hard to know what to make of this 
claim.  These levels surely can’t all be stored on the cartridge, it 
would be absurdly expensive.  On the other hand if they were storing a 
smaller set of grids and permuting them, the number is absurdly small 
since the group of sudoku-preserving symmetries has size 2×3!<sup>8</sup>×9! which is more than 3×10<sup>8</sup>.
  Perhaps this has a generation algorithm too and the number is 
marketing-speak (like the “3 billion combinations” of the first Rubik’s 
Cubes).</li>

</ul>

<p>Of course, <i>Zendoku</i> has many unique features not found in other sudoku games…</p>
